adb_notify
==========
Today I set my phone to silent in my new dock.
I then got annoyed because I didn't hear it over the sound of the music on my PC.
So I wrote a simple script, it uses the ADB to check your phone for notifications.
And if it finds new ones, it'll give you a heads up.

Bugs:
-New notifications from an app with an open notification will not show
-Strange name in notification on PC side
